# Program Objectives

## Main goal

Turn Tenmás into an **AI-Native** company: where the use of AI in software development is not optional or experimental, but the **work standard** for every engineer.

## What does being AI-Native mean?

It doesn't mean generating random code with ChatGPT. It means:

- **Integrated workflow**: AI in the editor, code review, tests and monitoring
- **Defined standards**: tested prompts, clear quality gates, visible metrics
- **Continuous improvement**: every week we measure, adjust and document learnings

## Objectives per week

### Week 1 — Base Stack
- Set up **Cursor AI** as the team's standard editor
- Integrate **CodeRabbit** in all Tenmás repositories
- Implement **PromptLayer** for prompt observability
- Automate workflows with **Make.com**
- Cover critical features with **Playwright** (E2E testing)

### Week 2 — Maturity and Standards
- Build AI pipelines with **LangChain**
- Create productivity dashboards in **Grafana**
- Publish documentation with **Docusaurus** (this site)
- Define and automate **quality gates** for AI-generated code
- Deliver reusable **playbooks** for the team

## Program KPIs

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Development velocity (features/week) | +40% vs baseline |
| Average code review time | −50% |
| Test coverage | ≥ 80% |
| Documented and reusable prompts | ≥ 20 |
| Updated documentation | 100% |

## Team commitments

For this to work, all Tenmás engineers commit to:

1. **Use Cursor AI** as the primary editor during the 2 weeks
2. **Not merging PRs without CodeRabbit review** from Day 1
3. **Log effective prompts** in PromptLayer when they find them
4. **Update this playbook** when they find something that's not documented
