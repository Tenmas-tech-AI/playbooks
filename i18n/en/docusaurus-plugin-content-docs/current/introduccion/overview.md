# Tenmás AI Playbooks

Welcome to the official AI standards documentation for the **Tenmás** engineering team.

## Why does this playbook exist?

AI is redefining how software is written, reviewed and maintained. At Tenmás we don't want to fall behind — we want to be at the **forefront**. This playbook exists so every engineer on the team works with AI the same way: with criteria, with standards, and with measurable results.

This isn't about using ChatGPT to autocomplete code. It's about integrating AI into every stage of the development cycle: design, coding, review, testing, documentation and monitoring.

## Who is it for?

| Role | How to use this playbook |
|------|--------------------------|
| **Developers** | Day-by-day guides, tool setup, recommended prompts |
| **Tech Leads** | Quality standards, quality gates, productivity metrics |
| **New team members** | Full onboarding to Tenmás's AI-Native stack |

## Team principles

### 1. AI as copilot, not pilot
AI speeds up your work, but you're responsible for the code. Always review, understand and validate what AI generates before merging.

### 2. Observability first
Every LLM call is logged. We use PromptLayer to audit which prompts are used, how much they cost and how effective they are.

### 3. Tests before merge
AI-generated code goes through the same quality gates as human-written code. Playwright runs E2E tests. No exceptions.

### 4. Living documentation
Documentation is updated with every change. This site is the standard — if something isn't here, it isn't defined.

### 5. Real metrics
We measure AI's impact on productivity with real Grafana data. If a tool doesn't move the metrics, we replace it.

## Program structure
