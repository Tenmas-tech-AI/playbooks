# Weeks 1–2 Plan

## Overview

10 days of structured work for the Tenmás team to adopt the AI-Native stack in an organized way. This isn't a sprint of experimentation — it's the official adoption program with concrete deliverables each day.

By the end of week 2, the team must have:
- The complete stack configured and in use
- Quality gates defined and automated
- Playbooks documented and published
- Productivity metrics running in Grafana

## Day format

Each day guide is structured like this:

```
Day objective    → What exactly will you achieve?
Setup           → Step-by-step installation and configuration
Exercises       → Hands-on tasks with specific instructions
Checklist       → Verification list at the end of the day
Resources       → Links, docs and additional references
```

## Program rules

:::info How to follow this plan
- **Don't skip days** — each day builds on the previous one
- **Do the exercises** — reading without practicing doesn't count
- **Report blockers** — if something doesn't work, document it in the team channel
- **Update the checklist** — mark completed tasks at the end of each day
:::

## Final deliverables

By the end of Day 10, the team delivers:

1. **Working stack** — all tools configured and in use
2. **Published playbooks** — coding, debugging, testing and documentation playbooks
3. **Metrics dashboard** — Grafana running with real KPIs
4. **Quality gates** — automated in CI/CD
5. **This site** — complete documentation in ES and EN
